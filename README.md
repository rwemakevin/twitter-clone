# Twitter clone

This is a web application created using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) to mimic the design and functionality of the official Twitter social networking service. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) is an American microblogging and social networking service on which users post and interact with messages known as "tweets". Registered users can post, like and retweet tweets, but unregistered users can only read them.

## Used Tools and Technologies

- ReactJS
- Redux (How can I install Redux)
- Ant design (what's Ant design)?

## Available Scripts & how to run this project on your local machine

### Get Started

- Clone this repo 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/patricktunez123/twitter-clone.git

$ cd twitter-clone/

$ yarn

$ yarn start

```

### Scripts

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from the project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into the project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.
